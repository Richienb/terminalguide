title: Terminal Bell Sets Window 'Needs Attention'
---
body:

If set, the terminal bell will set the terminal window's 'needs attention' flag.

The flag is only set when the window does not have window focus and it unset as soon as the window is activated.

In some environments the window will pulse or bounce if the flag is set.
