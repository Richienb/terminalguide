title: Select Character Protection Attribute (DECSCA)
---
body:

Select Character Protection Attribute.

if `cmd` = 1 the following printed characters are protected from selective erase. Otherwise the following printed characters are not protected from selective erase.

This is like an additional [SGR State](/attr) in that it modifies cells changed after this sequence until deactivated again with `cmd` != 1.

The semantics of protection from this sequence differs from {{seq_link('a_esc_cv')}} in that this protection only applies when using {{seq_link('csi_ck__p')}}, {{seq_link('csi_cj__p')}} and {{seq_link('csi_cx')}}. While the protection attribute is saved per cell the chosen semantic is global and the last seen sequence wins.
