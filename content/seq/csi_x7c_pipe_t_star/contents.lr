title: DEC Select Number of Lines per Screen (DECSNLS)

body:

DEC Select Number of Lines per Screen.

If `rows` >= 1 and `rows` <= 255 resizes the terminal to `rows` rows.

Modern terminals don't have a fixed height and users generally expect the terminal to keep the size they assigned to the terminal. This control violates that expectation.
