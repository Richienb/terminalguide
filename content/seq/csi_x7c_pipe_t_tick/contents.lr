title: DEC Locator Report Current Position
---
body:

Report the current location of the pointer using the DEC locator feature.

If `cmd` < 2 and the terminal is watching the pointer, it disables the locator, disabled all locator events and just sends a report of type 0.

If `cmd` < 2 and the mouse reporting mode is DEC locator:

The terminal replies:

{{seq('\033[0&w')}}

if the DEC locator is not the currently active mouse tracking mode or the pointer is outside the terminal.

Otherwise it reports the pointer position using a report of event type 1.

If one-shot activation is used after either reply the locator is disabled.
