Erases the complete display, by replacing all cell contents with space.

In it's basic variant it will also erase protected cells. When called as {{seq_link('csi-J|P')}} it will not erase protected cells.

The [current scroll region](/scrolling-region) is ignored by this command.

All erased space is colored according to the current [SGR state](/attr).

All lines are reset to normal size(i.e. not double height or width).
